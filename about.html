    <h1 class="about-me" id="hello-about">Hello! I'm Aleksandra</h1>
    <p class="about-me">I am a Computer Science student at the University of Southern Maine. As long as I can remember, I had a need to express myself creatively, as well as to design and understand mechanisms under the hood. I find great pleasure in writing clean and robust code and enjoy diving in the depths of software development.</p>
    <p class="about-me">After few years of a break from school I took a coding class and never looked back. I believe that I found what fulfills me and enjoy meeting and learning from other developers. At the Southern Maine Community College, I had an opportunity to tutor two programming classes: Programming Principles in Java and Object-Oriented Programming. This not only solidified what I had learned, but also connected me to others who had the same interests while giving me some insight as to others thought processes when it comes to problem solving.</p>
    <p class="about-me">Besides my interests in software development, I am very interested in visual arts and health. In my free time I enjoy exploring museums and staying active. I am fascinated by artistsâ€™ ability to make humanity rethink current norms, and shake it out of boring routines, moving our society forward. This is something I try to actively apply to my every day.</p>
    <p class="about-me">I believe in organization and order, and that simplicity is the best approach when solving even the most complicated tasks. My philosophy is simple as well: keep calm and solve problems.</p>
